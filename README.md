# Lab 3.2 Data Structures
## Task
Write a program that will take in a word from the user and reverses the inputted word.

## What will the Application do?
Take in a user input and display said input in reverse.

## Build Specifications/Grading Requirements
* Request and take user input (1 point)
* Create a separate method for reversing your string (3 points)
  * Return type should be a string
  * Parameter should be a string
* Inside your string reverse method, figure out how to reverse the inputted string using a Stack (5 points total)
  * Instantiating a stack: 1 point
  * Using the stack to store characters: 2 points
  * Using the stack to retrieve characters in reverse order: 2 points
* Display the reversed string in the console (1 point)

## Extended Exercises
* Consider cases where the user does not enter a single word but a sentence instead.
